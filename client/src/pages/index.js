                                My name is Victor Politano. I am a recent graduate of the University of Central Floridaâ€™s Full Stack
                                Web Developer Bootcamp and have certifications in Web Design and Programming from Valencia College. I
                                am skilled in the MERN Stack, (Mongo, Express, React, and Node), and have strong fundamental HTML,
                                CSS, and JavaScript skills. I am an excellent problem solver and I am excited to build applications with
                                a team that shares my passion for coding.
